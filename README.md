Graph operations, such as shifting, are relevant to EKR-type problems on graphs. I implemented shifting and other operations using NetworkX to build examples for pendant cycle
graphs. Note that the compress shifting function does not always preserve intersection, and was more of an idea I wanted to test while trying to prove if the cycle graph
is EKR.
